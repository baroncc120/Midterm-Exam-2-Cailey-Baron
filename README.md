# Midterm-Exam-2

For this midterm exam, we were tasked with analyzing global trends in milk production, and consumption, as well as to explore the different aspects of Taylor Swift's music and how they impact listening. 

In looking at the global trends, I chose to section the data by continent, rather than zoning in on a specific continent. This allowed me to look at data that was truly global, and allowed me many routes of how to divide and process the information given to us. I chose to create maps to track the highest and lowest years of both production and consumption, as well as including line charts to more clearly show how the rates of production/consumption changed over time. The America's are the worlds largest consumers of milk, but not the largest producers. This information allows us to reflect on how each continent is contributing to and depleting our resources, as well as opening the door to do further analysis about how to stabilize or change these trends moving forward.
